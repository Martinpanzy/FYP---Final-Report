\chapter{Introduction}
%It should begin with a clear statement of what the project is about so that the nature and scope of the project can be understood by a lay reader. 

In the past decades, robots have become an indispensable role in human life. Not only for the manufacturing industry, but there are also various types of robots in fields including healthcare, education, entertainment and military etc. No matter which category a robot belongs to, it is essential to endow the robot with some abilities so that it can perform corresponding tasks. Currently, there are mainly three approaches to teach skills to robots: direct programming, imitation learning and reinforcement learning, according to \citep{Kormushev_MDPI_2013}. However, there exists a trade-off between the difficulty to teach and computational complexity. Thus, a different approach should be adopted based on task specification.

\section{Motivation}
Speaking of non-industry environments, robot manipulation tasks usually cannot rely on hard-coded knowledge about the scene structure. This is because the environment can be modified by human actions, which is unforeseeable. Thus, a vision-based object recognition and localization system is extremely useful for providing the robot with scene knowledge. By combining computer vision techniques with motion planning, it enables robots to perform tasks more flexible and equip with a certain degree of autonomy.

\section{Objectives}
%ability independently to formulate and solve technical problems in project work. 
%project is intended to deliver, hardware, software, simulation, and analytical work.
Therefore, as my final year project, I aim to develop an algorithm for a bi-manual robot (Icub, Baxter or ABB YuMi) so that it can tie up shoelaces automatically. In the core project, starting with one arm holding one end of the shoelace, the robot should detect a shoe hole and plan an arm trajectory to pass the shoelace through that hole. For more challenging subsequent versions, the robot should be able to complete the whole shoe based on the planned sequences of trajectories. 

\section{Challenges}
The main challenge of the project is to calculate the angle at which the lace passes through the shoe hole. Secondly, how to use robot arms to achieve this task accordingly requires an accurate analysis. The optimal methods to localize the shoe hole and track shoelace need to be figured out as well. Moreover, plenty of tests regarding the motion planning algorithm need to be done in order to optimize the performance.
